# Welcome to vimdeck.nvim

A modern Neovim presentation tool

---

## Features

- Treesitter-based markdown parsing
- ASCII art headers with figlet
- Syntax highlighted code blocks
- Clean, minimal interface

---

## Code Example

Here's some Lua code:

```lua
function hello()
  print("Hello from vimdeck!")
  return true
end
```

Pretty nice, right?

---

### Lists Work Too

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

And quotes:

> This is a blockquote
> It can span multiple lines

---

## Navigation

- Space / PageDown: Next slide
- Backspace / PageUp: Previous slide
- q / Q: Quit presentation
- gg: First slide
- G: Last slide

# Thanks!

Made with Neovim + Treesitter + Lua
